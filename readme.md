# Chip8Compiler

Is a compiler which makes you able to write programs for your Chip 8 with a C-Like
syntax instead of raw assembler.

It's not finished yet, but I share this as a preview of its syntax and everything.
An example of the language is available at
[Chip8Compiler/main.c8](https://github.com/JacqueSatan/Chip8Compiler/blob/master/Chip8Compiler/main.c8).

The lexer and the parser are both working.

The files names are explicit, so it's easy to browse the code and understand what
it does. I may comment the code if I think it can be helpful.
